RFP Manager 🧠💼
An intelligent application built with Java and Spring Boot that allows teams to manage, create, and automatically respond to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) in a fast, structured, and business-oriented way.
This system combines a robust backend with modern AI integration, streamlining the creation of tailored proposals based on past data and best practices.

🚀 Overview
RFP Manager is a complete solution designed for companies that deal with technical and commercial proposals.
With a solid architecture in Java, a relational database, a simple web interface, and integrated AI, this application enables:

✅ Creation of professional RFP responses through a structured form
✅ Organization of key information: schedules, technical team, attachments, portfolio, certifications
✅ Reuse of past knowledge and training of the system using good/bad examples
✅ Generation of final PDF documents ready for submission
✅ AI-powered generation, improvement, and structuring of proposal content
The project is fully functional, integrated with a responsive frontend, and ready for deployment on AWS.
Only user authentication and final AI refinement remain before it’s market-ready.

🤖 Artificial Intelligence at the Core
One of the standout features of this application is its use of AI.
Based on examples of well-written and poorly-written RFPs (stored locally), the system uses few-shot learning with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to generate personalized, relevant, and well-structured content.

AI integration is handled via Spring AI (v0.8.1) and supports:

🔍 Retrieval of contextual examples
✍️ Automatic paragraph generation
🧠 Context-aware content structuring and suggestions
💡 Technologies & Tools Used
Area	Tools & Frameworks
Backend	Java 17, Spring Boot 3.4.5, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, JPA/Hibernate, Maven
AI	Spring AI (v0.8.1), Few-shot Learning, RAG Architecture
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Fetch API
Database	PostgreSQL
Output	PDF generation (automatic document creation)
Deployment	Apache Tomcat (embedded), AWS EC2
🌐 Frontend Integration
The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
It allows users to easily fill out a form that feeds into the backend.
Communication between frontend and backend is handled via Fetch API using JSON.

The UI is:

📋 Form-based and dynamic
📱 Responsive across devices
🧩 Integrated directly into the Spring Boot application (served via /static)
☁️ Deployment & Scalability
✅ Successfully tested and deployed on AWS EC2
☁️ PostgreSQL database ready for migration to AWS RDS
🛠️ Embedded Tomcat server enables standalone execution on any Linux environment
🔁 Modular structure allows the system to scale for different clients or sectors
🛣️ Roadmap
 Backend architecture with Spring Boot & PostgreSQL
 Full integration with HTML/CSS/JS frontend
 PDF generation of final RFP responses
 Successful deployment on AWS
 Initial AI integration with few-shot learning
 Implement user authentication with login/session handling
 Expand and refine AI training for better precision
 Final preparation for production launch with real-world users
🧠 Why This Project?
Responding to RFPs is often a slow, repetitive, and error-prone process.
This project automates much of that effort, improves response quality and consistency, speeds up delivery, and uses AI as a strategic assistant.

💡 Less time wasted
💡 Higher consistency
💡 More winning proposals
